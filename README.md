Why?

You need to do more! You need to spend more time on the essential complexity and less on accidental complexity.

But what is essential and what is 


What you need to do....

* Deploy business logic and assets on Kubernetes
  * Responding to HTTP requests (Jetty)
  * Business logic (Servlets)
  * Static files
  * Packaging as Docker image (jib-maven-plugin)
  * Deploying on a Kubernetes cluster
  * Bonus: Better logging with logevents

* APIs
  * Implementing REST controllers (JAX-RS)
  * Defining OpenAPI spec (spec first)
  * Serving Swagger-UI from Webjar
  * Using generated code in the controllers (openapi-generator-plugin)

* Frontend bundling
  * React application
  * packing into the Docker container (frontend-maven-plugin)
  * Generating frontend code from OpenAPI spec
  * BrowserRouter and default resource

* Authentication with OpenID Connect
  * Configuration

* Implementing database code with a micro ORM
  * Database migration (Flyway)
  * Transactions
